# More Skylore
Finite water, additional Botania flowers and other addons used by the Skylore modpack

## Features
### Aquafora
A functional Botania flower that consumes some mana to generate water blocks around itself.

### Finite water
A configurable option to make the water finite, just like lava. 
Meant to add a little spice to the game, or perhaps to annoy people.

## Technical information

- Requirements: Fabric API, Botania, Cloth Config
- Integrations: ModMenu
- Changing the config in-game still requires you to restart
